1. What is a firewall?
A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

2. Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?
A stateful firewall tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic.
A stateless firewall filters each packet individually without tracking connection states.

3. What are inbound and outbound rules?
Inbound rules control traffic entering a system or network, while outbound rules control traffic leaving it.

4. How does UFW simplify firewall management?

5. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?
Port 23 is used by Telnet, which transmits data in plain text, making it insecure and vulnerable to interception and attacks.

6. What are common firewall mistakes?
Leaving unused ports open, weak rule configurations, not updating firmware, and failing to monitor firewall logs.

7. How does a firewall improve network security?
It filters unauthorized traffic, prevents attacks, blocks malicious connections, and enforces network access policies.
